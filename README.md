HermesBDD is a novel multi-core and multi-platform [binary decision diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram) package focused on high performance and usability.
HermesBDD supports a static and dynamic memory management mechanism, the possibility of exploiting lock-free hash tables, and a simple parallel implementation of the ITE procedure based on a higher-level wrapper for threads and futures.

## Dependencies ##
HermesBDD has the following dependencies:

- **CMake** (mandatory), for compiling;
- **Sphinx** (optional), for documentation generation.

For further information about CMake and Sphinx, check the following [1](https://cmake.org/) and [2](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation pages, respectively.

## Building ##
The library is tested for compilation using GCC (minimum required: 10.2), Clang (minimum required: 11.0), and MSVC (minimum required: 19.20).
To build the library from sources in a clean way, it is preferable that you set up a build subdirectory, say:
```
$ mkdir build && cd build
```

Then, you can prepare the build environment, choosing a `Release` build for maximum performance:
```
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

At this point, if no error arises, you can build with:
```
$ cmake --build .
```

To install the library globally from built sources, you must do the following:
```
$ cmake --build . --target install
```
using `sudo` if you require administrator privileges for a Linux installation.
The installation will build the whole distribution beforehand, so it is better that you first build the other targets without administrator privileges to build the install target.

To find the installed library under Ubuntu, you may need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the `.bashrc` file of your home directory:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```

### CMake options ###

| NO_THREAD    | Do not use thread                    | OFF           |
| NO_DYNMEM    | Do not use dynamic memory allocation | OFF           |
| COVERAGE     | Enable coverage reporting            | OFF           |
